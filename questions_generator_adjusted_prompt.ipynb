There are two \\ntypes of simple circuits:  \\no A series circuit  is a circuit where current flows in only one direction.  The \\ntotal resistance (effective resistance) is the sum of all the resistors.  \\n𝑅=𝑅1+𝑅2+𝑅3 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure  1: a series circuit1 \\n \\no Parallel circuit : current flows in more than one path. The total \\nresistance is the sum of the reciprocal of each resistor.  \\n𝑅=1\\n𝑅1+1\\n𝑅2+1\\n𝑅3 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 2: a parallel ci rcuit2  \\n \\n \\n1The figure was snipped from An In -Depth Dive Into Series vs. Parallel Circuits | Advanced PCB Design Blog | \\nCadence  website.  \\n2 This figure was also snipped from An In -Depth Dive Into Series vs. Parallel Circuits | Advanced PCB Design Blog | \\nCadence  website.  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\nOther Important Definitions  \\n \\n• Electrical load  is an electrical component or portion of a circuit that consumes \\n(active) electric power.  \\no Examples : appliances and lights.  \\n• A switch : a device that can break the path of electricity in an electric circuit.  \\n• Two types of Electric  current s: \\no Direct Current : current (flow of electrons) always flowing in one \\ndirection . \\no Alternating Current : current (flow of electrons) changes direction  \\n \\n \\nVideo s:  \\n• Types of Electrical Circuits (youtube.com)   \\n• Direct Current versus Alternating Current (youtube.com)  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\nScience: Lesson 13 – Electricity : Formulas and Calculations  \\n \\nOhm’s Law  \\n• Voltage  is the difference in electric potential between two points.  \\no It also determines how much current will flow through a circuit.   \\no It is usually represented as V and its unit is the Volts, V. \\n \\n• Electric Current : the flow of  charged particles such as  electrons or ions moving \\nthrough an electrical conductor.   \\no It is usually represented as I and its unit is Amperes, A. \\n• Electrical resistance  is a property of a material that opposes the flow of electric \\ncurrent through it.   \\no The unit of resistance is Ohms represented by the Greek symbol, Ω. \\n \\nOhm’s Law: the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly \\nproportional to voltage across the two points.  \\n \\n𝑉=𝐼𝑅 \\n                                                    \\n \\n \\n• Electrical Power : the rate of energy use, or the amount of energy used per unit \\ntime.  \\no Electrical power is measured in Watts.  \\no Electrical power : calculated by multiplying the voltage and the current.  \\n𝑃=𝑉𝐼 \\n \\no Electrical power : calculated using the formula (from the above definition):  \\n𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟  (𝑊)=𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦  (𝐽)\\n𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒  (𝑠) \\n \\no One Watt is equal to one Joule per second.  \\n1 𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑡 =1 𝐽𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑒\\n𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑 \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\nCost of Electrical Usage  \\nThe formula used to calculate electrical usage cost is the rate multiplied by the energy.  \\n \\n𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 =𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 ×𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦  \\n \\no Cost is measured in cents  \\no Rate is measured in cents per kilowatts  hour  \\no Energy is measured in kilowatts  hour (kWh).     \\n \\nScience: Lesson 10  – Machines  \\n \\nMachine : any device that helps us to do work.   \\nSimple Machine : a mechanical device that helps us in performing work by multiplying \\nor transforming the force.  \\n• It is called simple because the machines operate on basic principles that \\ninvolves one movement.  \\n• Examples : a knife, bottle opener, axe etc.  \\n• There are six types of simple machines:  \\n1. Inclined plane  (examples include ramps, escalators, stairs) . \\n2. Wedge  (examples  include are saw, knife) . \\n3. Screw  (examples  include jar lid, corkscrew) . \\n4. Lever  (examples  include scissors, wheelbarrow) . \\n5. Pulley  (examples  include elevators, garage doors) . \\n6. Wheel and axle  (examples  include electric fan, drill) . \\n \\nCompound Machine : a combination of more than one simple machines.  \\n• Examples : a car engine, tractors operating on a farm etc.  \\n \\nMechanical Advantage : the ratio of the force output (load) to the force input (effort \\napplied to the load).  \\n• A value greater than 1 means that the effort is multiplied (less force is needed).  \\n• A value less than 1 means the speed is multiplied but greater force is required.  \\nM.A.=Force  output\\nForce  input \\n \\n• Mechanical advantage measures the efficiency of a machine. It could also be \\nrelated to the distance through the formula:  \\nM.A.=Effort  arm\\nLoad  arm \\n• These two formulas can be combined into one formula which is useful for \\nsolving problems related to levers.  \\nResistance  force  (load )\\nEffort  force=effort  distance  \\nresistance  distance \\n \\nVideo s:  \\n• Mechanisms: Levers, Axles, and Pulleys  \\n• Mechanisms: Inclined Planes, Wedges, and Screws  \\n• Mechanisms: Compound Machines  \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\nA Gear:  a wheel ( circle -like object ) with teeth.  \\n• Teeth are used to connect  two or more gears . They ensure one gear  doesn’t fall \\noff another.  \\n• Driver:  the gear that is forced to move .  \\n• Driven  (or Follower): is the gear that moves because of the first gear (driver).  \\n• Gear ratio  is the ratio of the driven (follower) gear to the driver gear.   \\no It indicates how many times a gear must turn for another gear to turn \\nonce.  \\no Gear ratios reduces the torque by increasing the speed and vice versa.  \\n \\nGear  Ratio =Number  of teeth  on driven  gear\\nNumber  of teeth  on driver  gear=Number  of turns  on driven  gear\\nNumber  of turns  on driver  gear \\n \\nExample:   \\n• See figure 1        Figure 11 \\n• Divide the driven gear teeth by the \\ndriver gear teeth  \\no Number  of teeth  on driven  gear\\nNumber  of teeth  on driver  gear \\no 30\\n20 = 1.5  \\no written as a ratio 1.5:1  \\n• The small gear rotates 1.5 times for \\nevery 1 time that the large gear rotates  \\n \\n \\nGear ratio is the mechanical advantage for gears.     \\n \\n \\nVideo:  Simple Machines – Gears  \\n \\n \\n1 Figure 1 retrieved from  4 Easy Ways to Determine Gear Ratio (with Pictures) (wikihow.com)  \\n',\n",
