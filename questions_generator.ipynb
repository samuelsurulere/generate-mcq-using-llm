Kinetic Energy is the energy of motion.  \\n𝐾.𝐸. =1\\n2𝑚𝑣2 \\n2. Potential Energy  is the internal energy a body  possesses  (or stored energy  in \\na body ). \\n𝑃.𝐸. =𝑚𝑔ℎ \\n \\nIt is essential to remember that t he weight of an object is the force exerted on the \\nobject by gravity, 𝑊=𝑚𝑔. \\n \\nLaw of Conservation of Energy : energy can neither be created nor destroyed but \\ncan be changed  from one form to another  or can be transformed from one system to \\nanother . \\n \\nWork : is the product of the force  applied on an object  and the distance the object is \\nmoved , i.e.,  \\n𝑊=𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒  ×𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  \\n                                             \\n \\n• Work is the transfer of energy (in or out of a system).  \\n• Joules  is also the  SI unit of work  \\n \\nRelationship Between Work and Energy  \\n• Work is the transfer of energy from one object to another.  \\no Work is performed when a force is applied in moving an object over a \\ncertain distance. This results in the change in energy of the object.  \\n• Energy is the capacity to do  the work  in moving that object over the distance.  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\nPower : the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred or \\nconverted.  \\n• Watts  is the SI unit  of power . It is also measured in 𝐽/𝑠 or 𝑘𝑊 or 𝑓𝑡 𝑙𝑏 sec−1. \\n \\n𝑃=𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑘\\n𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒=𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒  ×𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒\\n𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 \\n \\n                                                  \\nHorsepower  is another unit of measuring power. An important conversion to take note \\nof is:  \\n1 𝐻𝑝=746  𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑠  \\n \\nEfficiency : The efficiency of a machine is the measure of how much input power is \\navailable as actual output power.  \\n𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 =𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡\\n𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟  𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡×100%  \\n \\n• Efficiency tells us how efficient the machine is.  \\no If the efficiency is 100%, then the machine is perfectly efficient. This \\nmeans all the power is used with NO energy loss.  \\no If the efficiency is 0%, then all the input power is lost and the machine \\ncannot put  out any energy.  \\n \\n• Example: If a machine has an efficiency of 80%, it means that 80% of the \\npower input is converted into useful work, while the remaining 20% is lost as \\nwaste heat, friction, or other inefficiencies.  \\n \\n   \\n \\nScience: Lesson  4 – Fluids  \\n \\nFluid : A substance that can flow  and it doesn’t maintain a fixed shape.   \\n• Gases and liquids are usually considered as fluids.  \\n• Characteristics of fluids : compressibility, pressure, buoyancy, viscosity, and \\nsurface tension.  \\n \\nCohesive Forces  bind molecules of the same substance together  (particles within a \\nfluid being strongly attracted to each other). Cohesion:  \\n• Is strong in solids but weak in gases.  \\n• Is strong enough in liquids to keep the particles together but weak enough to \\nallow the molecules to slide  past each other. This lets liquids take the shape of \\ntheir container.  \\n \\nAdhesive forces  bind molecules of different substances together . Particles of different \\nsubstances are strongly attracted to each other .  \\n \\nVideo:   Adhesion, Cohesion and Surface Tension Part 10 (youtube.com)  \\n \\n \\nSurface Tension : a contractive tendency of the surface of a liquid that allows it to \\nresist an external force.
