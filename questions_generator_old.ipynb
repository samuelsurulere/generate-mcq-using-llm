Passing this exam will prove that you have the basic educational \\nrequirements for technical training in your trade. If you pass a trade entrance exam with a \\nmark of 70% or higher, you are eligible to attend technical training.  \\nTrade entrance  exams are given by Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training and can \\nbe written at any Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training Office (see page 34 &35 \\nfor locations).  \\nWhat’s the exam like?  \\nThere are five different trade entrance exams one for each  of the five different clusters of \\ntrades. Each cluster includes trades and occupations that have similar skill and knowledge \\nrequirements.  \\n \\nFor example, the Construction Craft Labourer occupation and the Hairstylist trade are \\nboth in Cluster 1.  These two  careers are very different, but require a similar knowledge \\nof English, mathematics and science in their first year of technical training. (see page 6 \\nfor a list of the trades and occupations in each cluster).  \\n \\nThe trade entrance exam for each cluster includes questions that test for educational \\nrequirements for the trades and occupations in that cluster. The exams are made up of 100 \\nmultiple -choice questions that cover the areas of English/reading comprehension, \\nmathematics and science.  \\n \\nDepending on w hich cluster the trade is in, there will be a set number of questions from \\neach of these areas as shown in the chart below.  \\n \\nYou have 3 hours to complete your exam. A mark of 70% or greater is required to pass \\nthe trade entrance exam.  \\n Cluster  English/Reading \\nComprehension  Mathematics  Science  Total \\nQuestions  \\n1 10 30 60 100 \\n2 22 50 28 100 \\n3 29 36 35 100 \\n4 22 33 45 100 \\n5 17 48 35 100 \\nAverage  20 40 40  Trade Entrance Exam  \\nStudy Guide  \\n4 \\nClassification: Protected A  How can this Study G uide help me prepare?  \\nMany people who write a trade entrance exam have been out of s chool for several years.  \\nThis G uide will give you an idea of the kind of questions that will be on the exam so you \\ncan see what areas you may need to address  ahead of time.  If you find you need some \\nhelp, the follow ing organizations may offer upgrading courses or pre -employment \\nprograms that can help you prepare to write the entrance exam.  \\n\\uf0b7 Bow Valley College  \\n\\uf0b7 Fairview College  \\n\\uf0b7 Grande Prairie Regional College  \\n\\uf0b7 MacEwan University  \\n\\uf0b7 Keyano College  \\n\\uf0b7 Lakeland College   \\n\\uf0b7 Lethbridg e Community College  \\n\\uf0b7 Medicine Hat College  \\n\\uf0b7 Mount Royal College  \\n\\uf0b7 Norquest College  \\n\\uf0b7 Northern Lakes College  \\n\\uf0b7 Olds College  \\n\\uf0b7 Portage College  \\n\\uf0b7 Red Deer College  \\n\\uf0b7 Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT)  \\n\\uf0b7 Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT)  \\nYour local school or school board may also be able to provide help in preparing for the \\nexam.  \\nThis Guide can also help you refresh and improve your study and exam writing skills. \\nUse it to practice before your exam.  Contact Apprenticeship and Industry Training toll-\\nfree at 1-800-248-4823  for information.  \\nWhat is in this Study G uide?  \\nThis trade Entrance Exam Study G uide includes:  \\n\\uf0b7 sample questions like those on any of the five trade entrance exams , \\n\\uf0b7 an answer key for  the questions included in the Study G uide, \\n\\uf0b7 study and exam writing tips , \\n\\uf0b7 copies of the formula and metric conversion charts used with the trade entrance \\nexams , \\n\\uf0b7 a sample diagram booklet that includes some typical diagrams used for the trade \\nentrance exams , and  \\n\\uf0b7 a list of the trades and occupations included in each cluster . \\n Trade Entrance Exam  \\nStudy Guide  \\n5 \\nClassification: Protected A  How do I use this Study G uide?  \\nThis Study G uide can help you become more comfortable with writing exams and the \\nkinds of questions included in each of the five trade entrance exams. There are 70 sa mple \\nquestions included in the G uide. Each one covers knowledge needed in at least one of the \\nfive clusters. The clusters a question covers are noted below it in the guide.  \\n \\nHere’s how you can use these quest ions to get ready for your exam.  \\n \\n1. Read each question in the Study  Guide  carefully to get an  idea of the kind of \\nquestions, the level of difficulty and the knowledge you will be tested on. This \\nwill help you focus your studying in areas need ing the most work.  \\n \\n2. Exam writing takes planning to ensure you have enough time to answer all the \\nquestions on the exam to the best of your ability and within the time allowed. \\nThese sample questions can help you determine how much time it will take you to \\ncomplete individual questions when writing the exam.  Practise reading over and \\nrecognizing the questions t hat will take more or less time to answer.  \\n \\n3. Look at the diagrams and formulas that are used in the  questions.  Ensure you can \\ninterpret what is shown in the diagrams.  Often, the questions that relate to \\ndiagrams require some interpretation and reasoning.  \\n \\n4. You may also want to study the formulas and conversion charts to make sure you \\nknow how to use them. You will be given the formula sheets and conversion \\ncharts to use during your exam.6 ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS ARRAY  \\n \\nENTRANCE 1    77/01/ 12/10 \\n \\nBarber  \\nConstruction Craft Labourer  \\nHairstylist  \\n \\nENTRANCE 2    77/02/ 12/10 \\n \\nBaker  \\nBoilermaker  \\nBricklayer  \\nCabinetmaker  \\nCarpenter  \\nConcrete Finisher  \\nCook  \\nCrane and Hoisting Equipment Operator  \\nFloorcovering Installer  \\nGlazier  \\nInsulator  \\nIronworker  \\nLather - Interior Systems Mechanic  \\nLocksmith  \\nMetal Fabricator (Fitter)  \\nPainter and Decorator  \\nParts Technician  \\nRoofer  \\nSheet Metal Worker  \\nWelder  ENTRANCE 3    77/03/ 12/10 \\n \\nAgricultural Equipment Technician  \\nAuto Body Te chnician  \\nAutomotive Service Technician  \\nHeavy Equipment Technician  \\nLandscape Horticulturist  \\nMotorcycle Mechanic  \\nOutdoor Power Equipment Technician  \\nRecreation Vehicle Service Technician  \\nTransport Refrigeration Technician  \\nWater Well Driller  \\n \\nENTRANCE 4    77/04/ 12/10 \\n \\nElevator Constructor  \\nGas Utility Operator  \\nGasfitter  \\nMachinist  \\nMillwright  \\nPlumber  \\nSprinkler Systems Installer  \\nSteamfitter – Pipefitter  \\n \\nENTRANCE 5    77/05/ 12/10 \\n \\nAppliance Service Technician  \\nCommunication Technician  \\nElectrical Motor Systems Te chnician  \\nElectrician  \\nInstrument Technician  \\nPower line Technician  \\nPower System Electrician  \\nRefrigeration and Air Conditioning Mechanic  \\n \\n \\nNOTE:  A pass mark earned on Entrance Exam 5 = deemed to have also passed Entrance Exams 4, 3, 2 and 1. \\n \\n A pass mark earned on Entrance Exam 4 = deemed to have also passed Entrance Exams 3, 2 and 1.  \\n \\n A pass mark earned on Entrance Exam 3 = deemed to have also passed Entrance Exam 1 (due to the \\n significant differential in math/science content, a pass ma rk on Entrance Exam 3 does NOT allow a pass \\n mark on Entrance Exam 2).  \\n \\n A pass mark earned on Entrance Exam 2 = deemed to have also passed Entrance Exam 1.  \\n \\nAlberta e ntrance exams are also used for entrance into apprenticeship programs in the Yukon, North west \\nand Nunavut territories.

(Do the easy questions or sections first - this is helpful for \\ncalming nerves and establishing your concentration.)  If your exam is all multiple choice, you may want to \\nnote where you should be after one hour  and after two hours to ensure you aren\\'t falling too far behind.  It \\nis important to work at a fairly quick pace; multiple choice exams are notorious for being long.  \\n \\nProcess the Question  \\nCareless mistakes are often made when students rush through the \"st em\" of the question, missing \\nimportant information.  Read the question carefully, noting key terms.  Watch for negative or positive \\nphrasing, or qualifying words like \"always\" or \"never\" which can drastically change the meaning of a \\nstatement. If you don\\'t  understand the stem, ask the exam supervisor for clarification.  \\nBefore you look at the list of possible responses, try to recall the answer on your own.  Then look at the \\nalternatives to see which one best matches your answer.  As you read through the pos sible responses, \\nmake a mental note of  the ones you know are wrong.  This will mean less reading time if you have to \\ncome back to the question later.  If none of the selections seems close, re -read the question and try to \\ndetermine what you missed.  If yo u still can\\'t get it, go on.  Something in another question may trigger \\nyour memory so you can recall the answer later.  \\n \\n \\n \\n31.
